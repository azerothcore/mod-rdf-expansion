# mod-rdf-expansion

### This is a module for [AzerothCore](http://www.azerothcore.org)

- Latest build status with azerothcore:

[![Build Status](https://github.com/azerothcore/mod-rdf-expansion/workflows/core-build/badge.svg?branch=master&event=push)](https://github.com/azerothcore/mod-rdf-expansion)

Allows to join RDF of previous expansions on a higher character level.

Up to character level 58, you can join the "Random Classic Dungeon":

However, once the character level hits 59, you can no longer join "Random Classic Dungeon" but you can only join "Random Burning Crusade Dungeon":

This is a client limitation. This module allows to hijack the type of RDF according to the configuration.

```
#
#     RDF.Expansion
#        Description: Allow setting which expansion can be used in LFG
#           2 - WOTLK (Default behaviour)
#           1 - TBC (if the player queues WOTLK RDF, join as TBC RDF)
#           0 - Classic  (if the player queues Wotlk or TBC RDF, join as Classic RDF)
#        Default:     2

RDF.Expansion = 2
```
